[Spreadsheet](./project-management/project-management.xlsx)

## Instructions

* Github Actions passing
  - Show Screenshot

<TODO:  
* Architectural Diagram (Shows how key parts of the system work)>

<TODO:  Instructions for running the Python project.  How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help.  Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

* Setup the cloud shell
  - Open the cloud shell from Azure Portal
  - Select "Bash" as input
  - Configure advanced options
  - Use new fileshare and new storage accounts if you have not created them already.
  - Run the following commands:
    - `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
    - `cat /home/odl_user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    - Copy the output of the `cat` command. It should start with "rsa"
  - Go to [github.com/settings/keys](github.com/settings/keys)
  - Add the new SSH Key

* Authorize the App Service
    - See the steps in [udacity](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd082/parts/cd1806/lessons/a415f839-37b3-4c7c-9bed-dc9764c4a08d/concepts/12055d15-9bd7-4a38-929f-133d24f64963)
    - 

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

* Output of a test run

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).
The output should look similar to this:

```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

* Output of streamed log files from deployed application
